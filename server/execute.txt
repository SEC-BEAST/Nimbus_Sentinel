You need to create a private environment to run the server script for that u can use 




#this will create the private env named myenv
python3 -m venv myenv
source myenv/bin/activate  # For Linux/macOS
myenv\Scripts\activate     # For Windows
 
# these dependencies are to be installed in virtual env
pip install art websockets openstacksdk python-dotenv aiolimiter keystoneauth1 python-novaclient python-glanceclient python-neutronclient


#installation could be verified by 

python -c "import art, websockets, openstack, dotenv, aiolimiter, keystoneauth1, novaclient, glanceclient, neutronclient; print('All dependencies installed successfully!')"

# Run the script 
python3 server.py
