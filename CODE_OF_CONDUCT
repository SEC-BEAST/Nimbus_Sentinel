Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

Our Commitment

As contributors, maintainers, and leaders, we are committed to ensuring that participation in our community is free from harassment and inclusive for everyone, regardless of their age, body type, abilities (visible or hidden), ethnicity, gender identity and expression, experience level, education, economic status, nationality, appearance, race, religion, or sexual orientation.

We pledge to engage and interact in ways that foster an open, welcoming, diverse, inclusive, and healthy community environment.

Community Standards

Behaviors that contribute to a positive community include:

Showing empathy and kindness towards others

Respecting differing perspectives, opinions, and experiences

Offering and receiving constructive feedback gracefully

Taking responsibility for mistakes, apologizing to those affected, and learning from them

Prioritizing what is best for the entire community rather than individual gains

Behaviors considered unacceptable include:

Using sexualized language or imagery, or engaging in sexual advances or attention of any kind

Making derogatory remarks, trolling, or personal/political attacks

Engaging in public or private harassment

Sharing private details of others, such as addresses or emails, without explicit permission

Conducting any behavior that can reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

Enforcement Responsibilities

Community leaders are entrusted with defining and enforcing acceptable behavior. They will take fair and appropriate corrective action in response to conduct deemed threatening, offensive, or otherwise harmful.

Leaders hold the right to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code contributions, wiki edits, issues, and any other community engagements that violate this Code of Conduct. When necessary, they will provide reasons for their decisions.

Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces and extends to instances where an individual officially represents the community in public forums. This includes activities such as using an official email, posting on an official social media account, or representing the community at an event.

Reporting Violations

Instances of inappropriate behavior, harassment, or violations of this Code of Conduct should be reported to community leaders. Reports will be reviewed promptly and handled fairly.

Community leaders are responsible for maintaining confidentiality and protecting the privacy of reporters.

Enforcement Guidelines

The following guidelines will be used by community leaders to determine consequences for violations:
